            I am a creative programmer from an artistic background. After 9
            professional years in making JavaScript banners, I am looking for my
            next career move as a front or backend developer where I can design
            and build more complex and sophisticated web applications. In
            addition to my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have been
            upskilling on various front and backend technologies. With a degree
            in Graphic Design, I had experience working as a graphic designer,
            specialising in layout and user interface design. My strengths in
            mathematics and problem-solving, honed both academically and
            professionally, enable me to tackle programming challenges
            effectively. With a diverse skill set and a passion for creating
            captivating digital experiences, I am eager to bring my expertise to
            your business.

            Outside of work I enjoy travelling. I have been to 510 cities in 46
            countries to date. Fine art is my other passion. I visit art museums
            every week and am myself a draughtsman. I am also a gym addict who
            visits four to five times every week. Of course all these happened
            in the good old days before Covid-19.

            Born in a Portuguese colony in China, I grew up in a culturally
            diverse environment and have now lived in the English capital for
            more than twenty years. My logo is an emblem of my three distinct
            cultural identities: the head of a Chinese dragon, the body of an
            English lion and the tail of a Portuguese rooster.
