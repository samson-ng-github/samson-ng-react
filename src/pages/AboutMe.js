        I have been developing display ads for a number of years now. I am
        looking for my next career move in React JS which I have been studying
        outside work. This website is written in React.

        Outside of work I enjoy travelling. I have been to 510 cities in 46
        countries to date. Fine art is my other passion. I visit art museums
        every week and am myself a draughtsman. I am also a gym addict who
        visits four to five times every week. Of course all these happened in
        the good old days before Covid-19.

        Born in a Portuguese colony in China, I grew up in a culturally diverse
        environment and have now lived in the English capital for more than
        twenty years. My logo is an emblem of my three distinct cultural
        identities: the head of a Chinese dragon, the body of an English lion
        and the tail of a Portuguese rooster.
